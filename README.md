# Basic-Game-in-Netbeans-8.2

The program contains two characters: Knight - Wizard

Both characters have: Attack level - Defense level - Life level - Name

The knight has a special function summon lightning

The wizard has a special function of healing his wounds and casting spells.

When you create an instance of the knight or wizard class, you have to pass its attack, defense, and life level parameters to create it.

The game asks if they want to defend or attack, if they attack they invoke power with a random number and with this attack they lower their opponent's life points.

Then your opponent randomly asks to attack or defend, if they attack, the attack will do a random number and will repeat until one of the characters reaches their life level to zero.

The wizard can raise his life level by 1 each turn.

Just place the folder inside your NetBeans projects.
